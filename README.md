## List of data-structures that are implemented -
* Doubly Linked List

* Stack
    - A growable array implementation of Stack
* Queue
    - (Interface for standard queue) MyQueue
    - (Interface for double ended queue) MyDeque
    - (Array implementation of MyDeque)MyArrayDequeu 
    - (List implementation of Queue) ListDeque
* Tree
    - BinaryTree (A generic binary tree data-structure)
    - BinarySearchTree (A comparator must be provided)
    - Red-Black-Tree (extends BinarySearchTree)

Look at the standard documentation in the files for more information on how to use these Data-Structures
